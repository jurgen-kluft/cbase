# Scheduled code changes for all base packages

## xcode

~~Support Tundra build system~~

## xbase

~~Split of containers into xcore/xgenerics~~

Simplify the whole string usage, currently we have code to handle ascii/utf8/utf16/utf32. Can we just use utf32 and remove all other code except the conversion from/to. Console, Log, printf/sprintf, sscanf etc.. should all just use a standard low-level string container that is utf32. It doesn't matter if there is dynamic allocation.
  
## xcore (typeless/raw containers)

- ~~list~~
- ~~array~~
- ~~stack~~
- ~~queue~~
- ~~tree~~

## xgenerics

- ``list<T>``
- ``array<T>``
- ``stack<T>``
- ``queue<T>``
- ``map<K,V>``

## xstring

string class (utf32)

## xallocator

We need a virtual memory based allocator :smile:

## xatomic

Do we still need these lock free data structures ?

## xhash

Just a simple interface here and a couple of hash candidates. This is just hashing, no encryption.

## xmerkle

Utilities to constract, update use merkle trees.

## xcrypto (AES)

## xrandom

A couple of random number generators

## xtime

Package for dealing with date and time

## xfilesystem

We need to redesign this a bit by limiting the feature set, design can consider multithreading but should by default be single-threaded

- xfile, xdir
- xfileinfo, xdirinfo
- xfilepath
- xdirpath

## xmemory

- Leak Detector
- Use the allocator to allocate the meta-data for the xrbtree

## xthread

- thread
- mutex, event, semaphore

## xp2p

- peer to peer library
- connections are peer objects
- 1st version = TCP
- later we can look at UDP; like uTP or UDX

## xactor

- erlang like actor framework
- slim/optimized
- maximum number of actors
- actors manage the messages they send and will get them send back as GC
- just sending messages

## xcmdline

trim down to the bare minimum, remove the ugly opt library.

## xtext

- support for localization manager (with compression ?)
- text reader/writer
- parsing/tokenizer
